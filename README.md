# MERN Stack Personal Library App

A fullstack personal library app that allows users to create a list of books. Users can add/view book information, update, delete and mark books as read.

## Motivation

This personal library app was built to showcase MERN Stack knowledge and abilities. I utilized React as the frontend framework with hooks in order to work with the API. I used Express and Node.js to create a backend API, handle routes and perform CRUD operations. Hosted and deployed to Heroku.
